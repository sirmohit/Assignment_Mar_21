    "    Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used in data preprocessing, particularly in the context of machine learning, to convert categorical data into numerical format. However, they have some key differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "    In ordinal encoding, each unique category is assigned a unique integer value.\n",
    "    The assigned integers have an inherent order or ranking, implying a meaningful relationship between them.\n",
    "    Ordinal encoding is suitable when the categorical values have a clear and meaningful order or hierarchy.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Consider a dataset with a \"size\" feature having categories: \"Small,\" \"Medium,\" and \"Large.\" Ordinal encoding might assign\n",
    "        integers like 1, 2, and 3, respectively, to represent the sizes based on their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Label encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique integer to each category without any inherent order.\n",
    "    This encoding is suitable when there is no meaningful order among the categories, and they are merely labels.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    If you have a categorical feature like \"Color\" with categories \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green,\" you might use label encoding\n",
    "    to assign integers like 1, 2, and 3 without implying any order.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    When to Choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use ordinal encoding when there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories, and preserving that order is\n",
    "    important for the model (e.g., low, medium, high).\n",
    "    Use label encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories, and treating them as unordered labels is\n",

    "    Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a\n",
    "    supervised learning setting. This method takes into account the relationship between the categorical variable and the\n",
    "    target variable and assigns ordinal labels accordingly. It's particularly useful when dealing with classification\n",
    "    problems where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate Mean/Median/Another Metric by Category:\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each category in the categorical variable, calculate a metric based on the target variable. This metric could be\n",
    "    the mean, median, or some other measure of central tendency of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "    Order Categories by the Calculated Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Order the categories based on the calculated metric in ascending or descending order. This establishes an ordinal\n",
    "    relationship among the categories, with the one showing a higher (or lower) metric treated as a higher (or lower)\n",
    "    category.\n",
    "    Assign Ordinal Labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their order. The category with the highest metric might get the \n",

    "    Replace Categorical Values with Ordinal Labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Replace the original categorical values in the dataset with the assigned ordinal labels.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Consider a dataset with a categorical variable \"City\" and a binary target variable \"Churn\" indicating whether a\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Covariance:\n",
    "    Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the extent to which two random variables change together. In other\n",
    "    words, it quantifies the degree to which the values of two variables tend to vary in relation to each other. Covariance \n",
    "    can indicate whether an increase in one variable would result in an increase, decrease, or no change in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Importance in Statistical Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relationship between Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Covariance helps in understanding the direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance \n",
    "    indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance suggests that one\n",
    "    variable tends to increase when the other decreases.\n",
    "    Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, covariance is not normalized, making it difficult to compare the strength of the relationship between different\n",
    "    pairs of variables. This limitation is addressed by the correlation coefficient, which is derived from covariance.\n",
    "    Portfolio Management in Finance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In finance, covariance is used in portfolio theory to assess the diversification benefits of combining different\n",
    "    assets. A low covariance between two assets implies that they are less likely to move in the same direction, providing \n",
    "    potential risk reduction when combined in a portfolio.\n",
    "    Calculation of Covariance:\n",
    "    The covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cov(X,Y)= n−1∑ i=1(Xi - X)(yi - Y)/n -1\n",
